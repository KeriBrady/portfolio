#My Online Portfolio

My online portfolio is built with semantic HTML5, Sass, media queries, a responsive grid, and a SMACSS-inspired file structure. It features my background skills and education, as well as some recent projects that will be periodically updated. Feel free to contact me about collaboration or work opportunities!
